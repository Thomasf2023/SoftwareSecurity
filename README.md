# SoftwareSecurity

**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**

Artemis Finacial is a finacial consulting company that uses a RESTful web application programming interface. The comapny was looking to increase its software security to protect themselves from outside attacks. Atermis Finacial deals with personal information of clients and it is important to them to be protected.

**What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**

I think what I did well was finding the dependency vulnerabilities in the application that was given. It is important to code securly because not doing so leaves your systems open to outside attacks. These attacks can be devestating to your comapny finacially and public relation wise. Attacks on software can also leave your costumers vunerable and can and have harmed millions of people.

**What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**

I think the biggest problem I had was doing the checksum verification. Trying to get my web client to accept my self signed certificate was a task that I found very difficult. It was helpful though because it showed me that it is important to have certificate authorities because anyone with a computer can make a certificate. 

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**

The way that I increased layers of security was by checking the dependencies of the application and finding their vulnerabilities. I also used the Secure Hash Algorithm, in this case SHA-256, to encrypt the message within the application. In the future, I would use the dependency check to check the dependencies of the application for vulnerabilites. 

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

The way that I made sure that the code and the software application were functional was by making sure that the application ran after I introduced any code. For example, after getting done with my checksum, I made sure that the application ran and that there were no errors. I did the same thing with any other edits that I did on the application including the POM files and the application properties. 

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

I think the coding practice of coding securely will help me with all future projects. The reason for this is because it gives me the mind set of going into a project knowing how important software security is. The resources in this class talked a lot about the software security mind set that a developer should have in order to develop secure code and that is something that I picked up and will use in the future.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**

I would show them my projects from this class to demonstrate the work that we did throughout the term.
